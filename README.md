## About This Book

In the remote vastness of the northern Rockies, a spirited young woman’s defiance of her husband’s warning draws her into a perilous encounter deep in the wilderness. Taken captive by a hunted outlaw, she is forced into a tense journey where survival, sympathy, and moral conviction collide. As danger closes in along a lonely mountain river, divided loyalties and buried fears rise to the surface. Set against an unforgiving frontier, this gripping tale explores justice, compassion, and the fragile line between belief and reality.
